To get started create an .env file in root directory and add SESSION={ur session}

There are only 3 commands that you should use:

1. just create {day} (To start ur project)
   - This will create the template for the problem of the day
   - Next it will retrieve the input for the problem of the day via ur session key

2. just run {day} {part} (To run you project)
   - This will first build the required files and then run it 
   - Output is visible via stdout
